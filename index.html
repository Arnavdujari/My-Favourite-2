    <p > My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keeps one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a succesful person in life.</p>
